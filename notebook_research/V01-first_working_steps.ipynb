    "# Working steps\n",
    "First working steps in getting to know the Dataframe Interchange Protocol and how to implement it to Vaex library for simple int and float without missing and chunking.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **2021/07/12**\n",
    "Researching `test_float_only()` from `pandas_implementation.py`. Learning about Vaex with collecting data into a Vaex dataframe, researching possible ways to do it. I started with two options to construct a dataframe from `np.array` and from `dict` (`vaex.from_arrays()` and `vaex.from_dict()`). \n",
    "\n",
    "- **2021/07/13**\n",
    "Adding `from_dataframe()` method that calls `_from_dataframe()` if `df` is not a `vaex` type dataframe. Dataframe in `vaex` is specified as `vaex.dataframe.DataFrame`. `DataFrameObject` is type `Any` (typing library). Also ` _VaexDataFrame` was added.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **2021/07/14**\n",
    "Adding `_from_dataframe()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The method goes through the columns one by one by the column name. It checks the data type in the column and then converts each column to match `vaex` column type. I will have to check which arrays are supported in `vaex` (ndarray, arrow array, ...). Two methods used in Pandas implementation are `convert_column_to_ndarray()` and`convert_categorical_column()`. I will deal with both for `vaex` in next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For now I set the `_VaexColumn` class, taking `expressions` for columns. Two methods adeed in `_VaexDataFrame` class are `column_names()` giving a list of column names and `get_column_by_name()` selecting an `expression/column` by the `name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Also `dtype` method for `_VaexColumn` class is set. Copy/pasted from Pandas implementation. Will see if I get into trouble later - I will need to check possible dtypes or Vaex.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **2021/07/15**\n",
    "Adding the check for more than one chunk of data, which is set to 1 by default in the current implementation (line 36 and 246).\n",
    "\n",
    "    I started with `convert_column_to_ndarray()` method where numerical and boolean columns are turned into numpy array just like in the Pandas implementation and then all the columns would be joined together by `vaex.from_dict(columns)` where `columns` are a dictionary list of all the columns in the dataframe saved by their name. I will deal with chategorical columns later.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Atributes `offset` and `describe_null` are set by default to 1 and a list respectively by this implementation protocol (line 68 and 71). Will probably need to apply changes to the list depending on how Vaex handles missing data. For now I am keeping it as it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **2021/07/16**\n",
    "Buffers!! Hurray! 😏\n",
    "\n",
    "    When we want to go from `__dataframe__` class to `vaex` dataframe class, we iterate by columns and define them as NumPy arrays, using NumPy buffers and then joining all the columns back from NumPy arrays to Vaex dataframe. No need for Vaex buffer location/understanding. I copy/pasted from Ralf's Pandas implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The transformation from Vaex float dataframe back to Vaex dataframe is sucessful. The values are the same, the structure is the same. I will learn to use pytest in Jupyter Notebook to test equality of values and also buffer location.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Testing buffer location isn't very clear to me. It looks like there is a copy being made even in the Pandas implementation. I have to check manually if the values in both dataframes change together.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2021/07/19&20**\n",
    "Kshiteej confirmed copy is being made somewhere. I will have to find where the copy is being made.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **buffer_to_ndarray**\n",
    "The copy is not being made in the method buffer_to_ndarray (tested with manual collection of data).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **to dataframe!**\n",
    "The other possibility is that it is being generated when dataframe is collected from columns that are made out of buffers. And it is correct! Even `pd.Dataframe` makes a copy unless the argument copy=False is added and the version of Pandas is 1.3.0 (doesn't work in 1.2.5).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2021/07/21**\n",
    "Change Vaex dataframe protocol so it doesn't make a copy as well and then test a loop: Vaex -> Pandas -> Vaex. It works!!! Hurray! 🎉\n",
